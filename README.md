# ImperiaOnlineBotForSavingArmy
C# application and Sikuli Bot for saving army in ImperiaOnline v5 game: The aim of this project is to develop a Sikuli-based bot for saving players army while he is not online. It was created, because Imperia Online developers ruined the game by putting all the players in the same part of the map, not allowing them to save their army and they became very greedy (all they want is players to spend their money on diamonds).

Most Sikuli scripts have to be updated due to differences in screen resolution, changes in the game etc.
